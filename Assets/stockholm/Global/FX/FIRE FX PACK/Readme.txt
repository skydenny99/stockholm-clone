Thank you for purchasing Fire FX Pack.

You can find the demo scenes under FIRE FX PACK/Scenes.
You can find the effect prefabs under FIRE FX PACK/Prefabs.

There's a FlickeringLights script included with this pack, which randomly flickers a light between a minimum and maximum range.

There's also a custom particle shader included, HDRFireParticle. This custom shader mimics the built-in Additive shader, with the exception of an HDR Multiplier slider which multiplies the image by some factor between 1 at the low end and 20 at the high end. This makes the particle effects work with tonemapping, and also works well with HDR-friendly bloom solutions such as Sonic Ether's Natural Bloom.
